I want to feel it seep into everyone of my cracks and crevices, nooks and crannies. I want it to envelop me in the sauce, slightly acidic, full of flavor. It slowly dissolves my body, causing it to fall off in chunks. My body becomes one with the gulas. I, as the gulas, consume others, until we become the best gulas in existence. Barrack Obama then takes this gulas in his private dining room and swallows it all, becoming engorged. He then waits in front of the fireplace as the gulas ferments and becomes even greater by absorbing his godly powers. Finally, Marco opens the door to the room when the time is right, letting every worthy soul on Earth lick Obama's stomach, become enlightened, and ascend to the heavens. The ones who are the gulas go to a higher heaven, only surpassed by Obama and Marco. All is holy. All is good. All is gulas.","date":"2020-05-15T17:56:32.494Z"}
